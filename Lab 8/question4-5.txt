You are assigning an additional variable that uses an additional function during the traversal
which makes the code more inefficient as the computation time is bigger.

A linked list would be better for accessing data when modification is frequent because it can modify data
without requiring every single element in the linked list to be shifted forwards or backwards. Instead it can change where
its pointers point to at any spot in the array.

An array is better for accessing data without frequently modifying it as data can be accessed at constant cost due
to the arrays ability to store index values for components in the array.
